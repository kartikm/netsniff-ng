An analysis by the Coverity Scanner is run occasionally against the source of
netsniff-ng. The corresponding scan reports can be found here:

  https://scan.coverity.com/projects/329

Use the command `make COV_EMAIL=<email> COV_PASSWD=<passwd> coverity' to trigger
a new scan yourself, if you are a project admin.
